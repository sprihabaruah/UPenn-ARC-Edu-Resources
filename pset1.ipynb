      "# Data, Data, Data \n",
      "\n",
      "ARC welcomes you to the 2010s. Less that ten years ago, if you were running a business, starting a company, making a decision, the biggest badest factor was always location. Not so anymore. Businesses, Governments and People are now driven more and more, by DATA. And if you have the data you have the power. Once again, check out this article  [this article](#) to better understand where we are coming from, and hope you enjoy. \n",

      "# The Data-tific Method \n",
      "\n",
      "So we know that we want it. We know that we need it. But how do we get it? Well there are three parts of the Data-tific Method: Finding Data, Getting Data, and Cleaning Data. Let's get started. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Finding Data\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is often the hardest part about the entire process. We might begin with the idea to correlate how tall CEOs are to a company's earnings per share (inspired by [this](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2008-03-13-bald-ceos_N.htm) for example). But understandably finding data on the heights of various CEO's is quite a tall order. So thus brings us the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "For now we will use readily available data, but later on, we will start to branch out, and this part of the task will become your job. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Data\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not spend too much time here, but do note: even if data exsists out there, does not mean that we can get our hands on it. Sometimes the data comes at a price (beleive me when I tell you most data comes with a price). Sometimes its just private, and regardless of how much you are willing to pay you just can't get it. And sometimes it is just too big. We can no longer fit the entire internet onto our laptops (though some of us can, eg [Watson](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?reload=true&isnumber=6177717) ). So sometimes its just too big. \n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt that we will deal with these issues to begin with, but do be aware. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cleaning Data \n",
      "\n",
      "Data comes in all shapes and sizes. It could be anything from: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Stock Prices \n",
      "* Tweets \n",
      "* Earnings Reports \n",
      "* Chats on CNBC\n",
      "\n",
      "And as one can imagine, even if I had all the audio files from CNBC for the past 20 years it would still be quite a task to make something out of it. Thus Cleaning Data becomes a big part of the issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, for now we will mostly handle that part of the job. We will start you off with clean, easy to get data, then start challenging you more as time goes on. \n",
